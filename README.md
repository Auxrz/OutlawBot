Outlaw was a bot previously made a few months ago to appeal to communities. I never quite got around to finishing it or even updating it, and I grew quite bored of the project. 
I made this when I was newer to coding so it's extremely messy and some things aren't as efficient as they could be. You're free to do anything with this repository, however if you
utilize the code, make sure to leave a link to this github : )

Side note : Command handler is not mine! I cannot remember where I got it off from, but if anyone knows the original author, please do let me know.
